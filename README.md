# Mequal Helpers

A Rego bundle of helper functions for policies based on [Conforma](https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/tree/main/policy/lib) used by Mequal as an extra bundle, for easier feedback message output and unit testing, and ensured compatibility of our policies with the [Conforma Policy Tool](https://conforma.dev/).
